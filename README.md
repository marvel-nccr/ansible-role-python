# Ansible Role: marvel-nccr.python

An Ansible role that installs a specific base python+pip version (`major.minor` only).

The executables will be available at `/usr/bin/python3.7` and `/usr/local/bin/pip3.7`, for the `python_base_version` specified.

The role is tested against: Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/20.04, Fedora 31 and CentOS 8 for python versions `3.6`, `3.7` and `3.8`.

You can also specify a path in which to create a virtualenv which uses this python version, with `python_venv_path`. By default `python_venv_packages` is set to install the latest pip, setuptools and wheel versions.

## Installation

`ansible-galaxy install marvel-nccr.python`

## Role Variables

See `defaults/main.yml`

## Example Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
  - role: marvel-nccr.python
    vars:
      python_base_version: "3.7"
      python_install_dev: true
      python_venv_path: "/tmp/my_venv"
      python_venv_packages:
        - pip
        - setuptools
        - wheel
      python_venv_state: latest
```

## Known Issues

- Python 3.7 is not available on CentOS 8
- `python_install_dev` and `python_install_tk` will not work for Fedora 31 if no Python 3.7 (`python3-devel` and `python3-tkinter` will be installed, which only work for the default python 3.7 version)

## Development and testing

This role uses [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for tests.

After installing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/):

Clone the repository into a package named `marvel-nccr.python` (the folder must be named the same as the Ansible Galaxy name)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marvel-nccr/ansible-role-python marvel-nccr.python
cd marvel-nccr.python
```

Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Installs molecule
molecule test  # runs tests
```

or use tox (see `tox.ini`):

```bash
pip install tox
tox
```

For testing specific distributions and python versions, .e.g.:

```bash
MOLECULE_DISTRO=centos8 MOLECULE_PYTHON_VERSION=3.8 tox
```

To manually inspect a container, you can run the converge and destroy steps individually:

```bash
tox converge
tox destroy
```

## Code style

Code style is formatted and linted with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit run -all
```

## Deployment

Deployment to Ansible Galaxy is automated *via* GitHub Actions.
Simply tag a release `vX.Y.Z` to initiate the CI and release workflow.
Note, the release will only complete if the CI tests pass.
